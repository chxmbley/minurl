Setup:

Ensure you have Node v12+ and NPM v6+ installed on your machine. If running scripts with the Makefile at the root of the
project, you should also have Make installed.

After cloning the repository, run `make setup` to install dependencies.
Alternatively, run the following NPM scripts in order to set up the project:

- `npm ci`
- `npm run db:migrate`


Starting the Server:

After setting up the project, run `make server` to build and launch the production server.
Alternatively, run the following NPM scripts in order to build and launch the production server:

- `npm run build`
- `npm run start`

In either of these approaches, the server will be available at http://localhost:3000/


Testing the Application:

After setting up the project, run `make test` to run the test suite.
Alternatively, run one or more of the following NPM scripts to run tests in isolation or with other scripts:

- `npm run lint` # Checks source code against ESLint and Prettier
- `npm run lint:style` # Checks stylesheets against Stylelint
- `npm run test` # Runs unit test suites using Jest
- `npm run build` # Builds the application for production
- `npm run db:migrate:test` # Runs database migration for a distinct test database (separate from app database)
- `npx dotenv -e .env.test start-server-and-test start http://localhost:3000 cypress:headless` # Starts the server and runs end-to-end tests using Cypress
